# UWP App Companion
A browser extension to serve as a companion to various 3rd party UWP apps, enabling a smooth transition from Website to App

This project is an evolution of the [MyTube Companion](https://github.com/Arlodotexe/myTube-Companion), whose sole purpose was to redirect from YouTube's website to the MyTube app. By using a third party app, you gained access to features that were unavailable to a web browser or that the big guys don't want to implement, such as Picture in picture mode and ad-free viewing.

With cooperation from many third party UWP developers, a touch of [Fabric UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/), and little elbow grease, the MyTube Companion was completely torn apart and put back together again in the form of the UWP Companion. From the code that turns the gears to the design of the User Interface, everything has been greatly improved over it's predecessor.
